# fuber

FUBER: A simple Taxi booking service 

## Setup

Fuber is a Clojure based application and makes use of Leiningen.
You must install all of the following so as to run Fuber:
Clojure, Leiningen, JDK, MySQL

Now, clone this repo:<br>
```
git clone https://github.com/55abhilash/fuber
cd fuber
```
We need to setup MySQL database for Fuber to use. <br>
Database setup script and sample data is included in fuber/db/.
```
sudo mysql --local-infile -u root -p < db/dbsetup.sql
```

[Note: If you have MySQL privileges to create database and tables, no need to run the above command with sudo]<br>
This script will create database, tables, and a DB user called 'fuber'. It will also load sample data from fuber/db/taxis.csv.

Once database setup is done, simply run 'leiningen run' to start Fuber endpoint service.
```
sudo leiningen run
```

It will start on host http://localhost:3000/

To run Leiningen tests on the API endpoint functions, simply run:
```
lein test fuber.core-test
```
