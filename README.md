# Fuber

FUBER: A simple Taxi booking service 

## Setup

Fuber is a Clojure based application and makes use of Leiningen.<br>
Following are the prerequisite software which are required by Fuber and must be installed on your system:
* Leiningen 
* JDK (OpenJDK or Oracle JDK)
* MySQL

Now, clone this repo:<br>
```
git clone https://github.com/55abhilash/fuber
cd fuber
```
We need to setup MySQL database for Fuber to use. <br>
Database setup script and sample data is included in fuber/db/.
```
sudo mysql --local-infile -u root -p < db/dbsetup.sql
```

[Note: If you have MySQL privileges to create database and tables, no need to run the above command with sudo]<br>
This script will create database, tables, and a DB user called 'fuber'. It will also load sample data from fuber/db/taxis.csv.

Once database setup is done, simply run 'leiningen run' to start Fuber endpoint service.
```
sudo lein run
```

It will start on host http://localhost:3000/

To run Leiningen tests on the API endpoint functions, simply run:
```
lein test fuber.core-test
```

### View Taxis on Map

Additionally, there is a visual representation of all (non assigned) Taxis on a world map. This is included in the folder fuber/ui/.

To view the representation, open the following in your browser:

file:///path_to_fuber/ui/index.html

Replace 'path_to_fuber' with the actual path of fuber on your machine.

## Examples

Find Nearest Taxi:

http://localhost:3000/findTaxi?pinkRequired=false&lat=18&long=75
```
{
    "taxi_id": 5,
    "latitude": 17.0,
    "longitude": 74.0,
    "driver_name": "Usha",
    "driver_id": 5,
    "driver_no": "1234567890"
}
```
Book the Taxi and start Trip. Pass Taxi ID obtained in previous request:

http://localhost:3000/startTrip?taxi_id=5&lat=18&long=75
```
{
    "ride_id": 38,
    "taxi_id": 5
}
```
End Trip. Pass Ride ID obtained in previous request:

http://localhost:3000/endTrip?ride_id=38&taxi_id=5&lat=19&long=76
```
{
    "fare": "9.82842712474619 dogecoins"
}
```
Fare is calculated as follows: 2 dogecoins per km and 1 dogecoin per minute of trip.
Additional 5 dogecoins if Taxi is Pink.
